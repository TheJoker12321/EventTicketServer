The project allows you to manage a user system that creates events and reports. You need to run run.js and then start the routes.

To check that the server is working, you need to start by routing /health

After that, follow the code to understand which routes you need and what they generally do. You can create events, reports, and users, and also get information about the reports, such as total, average, event names for that user, and so on.
